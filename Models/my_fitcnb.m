% Description: create a model ready to perform NB classification
% from some training data
%
% Inputs:
% train_examples: a numeric array containing the training examples
% train_labels: a categorical array containing the associated
% labels (i.e., with the same ordering as train_examples)
%
% Optionally, the user can also ask to switch on 'Verbose' mode (via and
% extra name-value pair) causing the model to generate debug
% 
% Outputs:
% m: a my_ClassificationNaiveBayes object holding the parameters of the
% resulting model
% 
% Notes:
% The only job here is to create instantiate an object from the relevant
% class and hand it back; just providing equivalence with the Matlab
% implementation for familiarity/ease of use
%
function m = my_fitcnb(train_examples, train_labels, varargin)

    % take an extra name-value pair allowing us to turn debug on:
    p = inputParser;

    p.parse(varargin{:});

    % use the supplied parameters to create a new
    % my_ClassificationNaiveBayes object: 

    m = my_ClassificationNaiveBayes(train_examples, train_labels);
