# CustomModels
A compilation of the work done in my Machine Learning module. A naive attempt to replicate the behavior of built in MATLAB machine learning models. All the fit functions work identical to the inbuilt MATLAB fit functions.

# Models
The models that have been made are:
+ Naive Bayes
+ KNN
  - Using naive brute force search.
  - Using k-d search
+ Decision Tree
+ Perceptron (Net with 0 hidden layers)
+ Ensemble
  - All models use same template featur as MATLAB.
